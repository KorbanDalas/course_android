/**
 * - THE PROBLEM -
 * Write a program where user needs to guess a number.
 * The problem is to guess what a number a computer has in mind.
 * You will write a program that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 100.
 * The program prompts the user to enter a number continuously until the number
 * matches the randomly generated number. For each user input, the program tells
 * the user whether the input is too low or too high, so the user can make the
 * next guess.
 * <p>
 * - OUTPUT EXAMPLE -
 * Console output should look like this:
 * <p>
 * >> Guess a magic number between 0 and 100
 * >> Enter your guess: 50 (user presses enter)
 * >> Your guess is too high
 * >> Enter your guess: 25 (user presses enter)
 * >> Your guess is too high
 * >> Enter your guess: 12 (user presses enter)
 * >> Your guess is too high
 * >> Enter your guess: 6 (user presses enter)
 * >> Your guess is too low
 * >> Enter your guess: 9 (user presses enter)
 * >> Yes, the number is 9
 * <p>
 * - HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM -
 * 1. Don't start coding. Write down the steps in words (use Java comments for that).
 * 2. Implement steps one by one.
 * 3. Start by creating a random number and storing it in a variable.
 * 4. Get user guess from user input (use Scanner).
 * 5. Implement conditional statements (if-else statements) to check the guess.
 * 6. Wrap the logic in a loop to continue asking for a guess until the user guesses correctly.
